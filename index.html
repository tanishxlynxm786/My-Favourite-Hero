        <h2>About Spider-Man</h2>
        <p>Spider-Man beloved character of the fans created by Stan Lee a.k.a Peter Parker is normal guy in Earth 616 or was a normal guy
            until he got bit by a radioactive spider created by Oscorp Industries which gave him super powers mainly strength of a spider,
            agility of a spider, and most famous of those abilities is his spider sense. He uses this powers to help others even when he knowns
            they can't help him back while behind the spidey suit he is a normal guy to others. While helping the control and fight the villains
            terroring the lives in NYC with his arachnid abilities he constantly finds himself fighting his own normal life obstacles which most
            of us can relate with IRL. Spider-Man first appeared in the anthology comic book(as Sheldon Cooper tells us not to mistake comics with
            comic books which I myself kinda agree with) Amazing Fantasy#15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books.
